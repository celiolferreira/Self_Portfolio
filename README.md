/* A Jupyter Notebook in which I used Python's libraries Pandas and DuckDB to connect to a database and extract the data with
SQL in order to build a report presenting the average number of cases and the average numbers of deaths by Covid-19 from 
2020 to 2023 in the United States of America, specifically in California and Florida states. */

-- This little project was made to accomplish a DuckDB exercise from Data Science Academy (DSA)
-- The original project used Docker, but I felt like doing it some other way.
-- In the end, I discovered another path - with different tools - to attain the same result.
